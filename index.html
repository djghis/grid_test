		<!--
      Coding test using GRID when you change the size of the screen following these instructions.

      The exercise consists of two tasks:
      1. Building the Card component (HTML and CSS).
      2. Creating a responsive Listing of 5 or 6 Cards that changes its look depending on the screen size (HTML and CSS).

      The attached iframe is a reference to a mock-up of how the cards should look like in both versions: vertical (mobile) and horizontal (desktop). 

      The list should behave so you can see:
      - two horizontal (desktop) cards in a row on a 'large' screen
      - two vertical (mobile) cards in one row on a 'medium' screen
      - one horizontal (desktop) card on a 'small' screen
      - one vertical (mobile) card for evertyhing smaller than that
      (you probably want to build mobile first so work through this list from bottom to top)
